# Search for books
This is currently a small project which allows you to search books and it'll
return the author and the year of the latest publication. It uses the Open
Library API to look up the information for the books.

The goal is to allow the user to organize their book list as well as track the
page they are on for each book.

A loftier goal is to recommend books that the user might like based on the books
that they have already read.

# How to run
## Pre-requisites
You must have Python installed and be able to run it in a command-line interface.
## Running
```
python organize.py
```
You can then choose to search for a title by hitting the 's' key.
